Version 1.4.32:
- A recipient list on the command line is now parsed as if it appeared in a
  mail header.

Version 1.4.31:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.30:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.29:
- The obsolete service name "ssmtp" was replaced with "smtps".

Version 1.4.28:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.27:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.26:
- A new version of the msmtpq script fixes serious bugs. To update to the new
  version of the script, you need to remove the old msmtpQ symlink, change
  msmtpQ to msmtpq in your MUA config, and use msmtp-queue for queue management.

Version 1.4.25:
- DIGEST-MD5 authentication is not considered secure any longer. See RFC 6331.
- Support for alias expansion was added. See the aliases command and --aliases
  option.

Version 1.4.24:
- The build system was updated, and as a consequence some options to the
  configure script have changed. See './configure --help'.
- The license of the manual was changed from the GNU FDL to a very simple
  permissive license.
- The unmaintained pt_BR translation was removed.

Version 1.4.23:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.22:
- A new command 'passwordeval' with a corresponding '--passwordeval' option
  allows to set the password to the output of a command.

Version 1.4.21:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.20:
- Added support for authentication mechanism SCRAM-SHA-1 via GNU SASL.
- The new command tls_fingerprint allows one to trust one particular TLS
  certificate, in case tls_trust_file cannot be used for some reason.
- The new script msmtp-gnome-tool.py manages Gnome Keyring passwords for msmtp.

Version 1.4.19:
- When using OpenSSL, msmtp now correctly handles NUL characters in the Common
  Name and Subject Alternative Name fields of certificates. This fixes a 
  security problem. Note that msmtp is not affected by this problem if GnuTLS is
  used.

Version 1.4.18:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.17:
- Msmtp now also reads SYSCONFDIR/netrc if the password was not found in 
  ~/.netrc.
- Support for the GNOME keyring was added by Satoru SATOH.

Version 1.4.16:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.15:
- The configuration command tls_crl_file was added. This allows to use 
  certificate revocation lists (CRLs) during certificate verification.
- The configuration command tls_min_dh_prime_bits was added. This may be needed
  to use TLS/SSL with servers that use a small Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime size.
- The configuration command tls_priorities was added. This allows to fine tune 
  TLS/SSL session parameters.

Version 1.4.14: 
- The -t option now properly supports Resent-* headers.
- The --read-envelope-from option was added. It allows to read the envelope from
  address from the From header.
- The environment variables SMTPSERVER and EMAIL can be used to configure msmtp
  for simple use cases.
- Support for the Mac OS X keychain was added by Jay Soffian.

Version 1.4.13: 
- Useful scripts are now distributed in the scripts subdirectory.
- The license was updated to GPLv3 or later (source code) and GFDLv1.2 or later
  (documentation).

Version 1.4.12: 
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.11: 
- Security improvements:
  - TLS requires tls_trust_file or a disabled tls_certcheck now, so that it is 
    not silently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - NTLM authentication is considered insecure because it is undocumented. It is
    therefore not used automatically without TLS anymore.

Version 1.4.10:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.9:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.8:
- No significant changes.

Version 1.4.7:
- The configuration command tls_force_sslv3 was added. This is needed to use
  TLS/SSL with some old and broken servers.

Version 1.4.6:
- The options to the configure script have changed! See the first few
  paragraphs of INSTALL for details.
- Optional support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) was added. 
  GNU Libidn is required for this.

Version 1.4.5:
- Only minor tweaks.

Version 1.4.4:
- Support for the sendmail -F option (accepted but ignored).
- Removed the OpenSSL exception note from the license information.

Version 1.4.3:
- Automatic envelope-from addresses are only generated when auto_from is enabled
  with the new auto_from command or --auto-from option.
  This allow empty envelope from addresses to be set with the from command or 
  --from option.

Version 1.4.2:
- The 'connect_timeout' setting was replaced by a 'timeout' setting that applies
  to all network operations. The old option and command are still accepted, but 
  they are not restricted to connection attempts anymore.
- Native language support (NLS) was added. Currently the only supported language
  besides english is german, but it is easy to add more translations (hint, 
  hint)!

Version 1.4.1:
- Only bug fixes, no new features.

Version 1.4.0:
- This is the new stable release of msmtp.
  BEWARE: When upgrading from 1.2.4, note that
  - Authentication is not enabled automatically anymore! Insert the command
    "auth on" into account definitions that need it.
  - Some command line options have changed!
- Summary of new features since 1.2.4:
  - Sendmail compatible command line options, including -t, -N, and -R
  - New long options to configure almost everything on the command line
  - Optional account selection with -f/--from
  - Support for a system wide configuration file
  - Optional automatic construction of envelope from addresses
  - More flexible account definitions
  - Configurable connection timeouts
  - Improved log file logging
  - Syslog logging
  - Improved TLS/SSL support
  - Support for LMTP
  - Support for the EXTERNAL and GSSAPI authentication methods
  - Support for .netrc and password prompting
  - Rewritten documentation, available in various formats
- New since 1.3.9:
  - No new features, but minor improvements mainly regarding interoperability
    and performance. And some minor bug fixes.

Version 1.3.9:
- Added support for the .netrc file: If a password is needed but none is given, 
  msmtp will try to find it in ~/.netrc, and if that fails, msmtp will prompt 
  you for it.
- The authentication user name is included in the log if authentication is used.
  Suggested by Jim Fohlin.
- An account from the system configuration file cannot be partially changed in
  the user configuration file anymore; it must be replaced completely instead.
- Added LMTP support.

Version 1.3.8:
- The default values from a defaults section in a system configuration file
  are not valid in the user configuration file anymore, to prevent changes in 
  the system configuration file from breaking user setups.

Version 1.3.7:
- The user configuration file is required to have no more permissions than 
  0600 (user read/write).
- Added specialisation to account definitions. See documentation of the
  account command and the example files.
- Added the new connect_timeout command and --connect-timeout option.
- The password will be prompted for if none is given in the configuration file.

Version 1.3.6:
- New documentation!
  It was rewritten using texinfo, which allows easy generation of html and pdf
  documents.
  The man page is still up to date and will not be dropped.
- A new configuration file command ("defaults") to set default values for all 
  following accounts was added. Suggested by Jim Fohlin.
- Support for EXTERNAL authentication was added.
- You need GnuTLS >= 1.2.0 now if you want GnuTLS support.
- bug fixes!

Version 1.3.5:
- A system wide configuration file SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc will be used if it exists.
  It's settings will be overridden by the the user configuration file.
  Use the --sysconfdir configure option to set SYSCONFDIR to something other 
  than /usr/local/etc.
- If no envelope from address is given, msmtp will construct one using the user
  name and the mail domain (if given).
- New command/options pairs:
  - maildomain/--maildomain to set the domain part of constructed envelope from
    addresses
  - syslog/--syslog to enable logging to syslog

Version 1.3.4:
- Just some cleanups and bugfixes. The built-in CRAM-MD5 code works again.

Version 1.3.3:
- support for Remote Message Queue Starting (RMQS) was added, see option --rmqs
- msmtp can now print information about the peer's TLS certificate.
  Use --serverinfo (or --debug) to see it
- If you want GnuTLS as your TLS library, you need a version >= 1.1.23 now

Version 1.3.2:
- You need gsasl or libgsasl >= 0.2.4 if you want GNU SASL support
- Various bugfixes

Version 1.3.1:
- fixed the -t option

Version 1.3.0:
- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
  - configuration file:
    - The auth command is now *required* to activate authentication. Just 
      setting user name and password is not enough anymore
    - The tls_nostarttls command should be changed to "tls_starttls off",
      though the old command is still supported
    - The tls_nocertcheck command should be changed to "tls_certcheck off",
      though the old command is still supported
  - command line:
    - Changed short options (because of collision with sendmail options):
      -p is now -P
      -F is now -C
      -v is not available anymore, use --version
      -h is not available anymore, use --help
    - If you used -f/--from without -a/--account to override the envelope from
      address of the default account, you have to use --account=default 
      explicitly now, because otherwise msmtp tries to find an account matching
      the from address
- NEW FEATURES:
  - Sendmail compatible interface
  - Almost all options can now be set on the command line
  - Support for the sendmail -t option (read additional recipient addresses 
    from the To, Cc, and Bcc headers of the mail)
  - You can choose the account using the -f/--from option:
    If you use -f/--from but not -a/--account, the first account of the
    configuration file that has a matching envelope from address will be used
  - GSSAPI authentication (you need GNU SASL >= 0.2.3 with GSSAPI support)
  - New command ntlmdomain to set the domain parameter for NTLM authentication
- CHANGES:
  - Long option support on all platforms (thanks to gnulib)
  - Enhanced almost all commands to allow unsetting of features
  - Changed log file information: Instead of conffile/account, log
    information about host, tls, auth, and from.

Version 1.2.4:
- No new features.

Version 1.2.3:
- IPv6 support on Windows systems
- The configuration file supports all commands and arguments related to
  TLS and authentication, even if TLS and/or GNU SASL support is not 
  compiled in
- The GNU SASL library is not required to support DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM 
  anymore. This means you can now use the packaged versions of the library 
  from Gentoo or Debian sarge.
- You can use the -v/--version option to find out which authentication
  methods are supported.

Version 1.2.2:
- Enhancements to the logfile command:
  - All available information is now written to the logfile (new fields: 
    mailsize=..., smtpmsg='...', errormsg='...').
  - Logging to standard output is possible by using "logfile -"

Version 1.2.1:
- No new features.

Version 1.2.0:
- This version can be compiled without TLS/SSL support; use 
  --disable-ssl if you really want that.

Version 1.1.2:
- No user visible changes.

Version 1.1.1:
- The tls_nostarttls command now sets the default port to 465 (ssmtp).

Version 1.1.0:
- Support for SMTP command pipelining. On high latency networks, this 
  may increase transmission speed, especially when sending to many
  recipients.
- The short option for --file, -f, has changed to -F
- A new option --from/-f is available to set the envelope from address.
- A new option --serverinfo/-S is available to print information
  about the capabilities and limitations of an SMTP server

Version 0.7.0:
- Support for DSN (Delivery Status Notifications) was added via
  the new commands 'dsn_notify' and 'dsn_return'.

  certificate checks. Use it if you get certificate check errors but
  still want to use the SMTP server with TLS/SSL.
- The 'nostarttls' command is now called 'tls_nostarttls'. 
  Please update your configuration file.

Version 0.6.5:
- License clarification:
  msmtp is released under the GPL with the additional exemption that
