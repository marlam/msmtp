.SH NAME
msmtp \- An SMTP client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP "Sendmail mode (default):"
.B msmtp
[option...] [\-\-] recipient...
.br
.B msmtp
[option...] \-t [\-\-] [recipient...]
.IP "Configuration mode:"
.B msmtp
\-\-configure <mailaddress>
.IP "Server information mode:"
.B msmtp
[option...] \-\-serverinfo
.IP "Remote Message Queue Starting mode:"
.B msmtp
[option...] \-\-rmqs=\fIhost\fP|\fI@domain\fP|\fI#queue\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
In the default sendmail mode, msmtp reads a mail from standard input and sends
it to an SMTP server for delivery.
.br
In server information mode, msmtp prints information about an SMTP server.
.br
In Remote Message Queue Starting mode, msmtp sends a Remote Message Queue
Starting request for a host, domain, or queue to an SMTP server.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The standard sendmail exit status codes are used, as defined in sysexits.h.
.SH OPTIONS
Options override configuration file settings.
.br
They are compatible with sendmail where appropriate.
.IP "\fBGeneral options\fP"
.RS
.IP "\-\-version"
Print version information, including information about the libraries used.
.IP "\-\-help"
Print help.
.IP "\-P, \-\-pretend"
Print the configuration settings that would be used, but do not take further
action.  An asterisk (`*') will be printed instead of your password.
.IP "\-v, \-d, \-\-debug"
Print lots of debugging information, including the whole conversation with the
SMTP server. Be careful with this option: the (potentially dangerous) output
will not be sanitized, and your password may get printed in an easily decodable
format!

address. This option allows one to set a full name to be used in that header.
.IP "\-\-"
This marks the end of options. All following arguments will be treated as
recipient addresses, even if they start with a `\-'.
.RE
.PP
The following options are accepted but ignored for sendmail compatibility:
.br
\-B\fItype\fP, \-bm, \-G, \-h\fIN\fP, \-i, \-L \fItag\fP, \-m,
\-n, \-O \fIoption=value\fP, \-o\fIx\fP \fIvalue\fP
.SH USAGE
A suggestion for a suitable configuration file can be generated using the
\-\-configure option.
Normally, a system wide configuration file and/or a user configuration file
contain information about which SMTP server to use and how to use it, but
all settings can also be configured on the command line.
.br
The information about SMTP servers is organized in accounts. Each account
describes one SMTP server: host name, authentication settings, TLS settings,
and so on. Each configuration file can define multiple accounts.
.PP
The user can choose which account to use in one of three ways:
.IP "\-\-account=\fIid\fP"
Use the given account. Command line settings override configuration file
settings.
.IP "\-\-host=\fIhostname\fP
Use only the settings from the command line; do not use any configuration file
data.
.IP "\-\-from=\fIaddress\fP or \-\-read\-envelope\-from"
Choose the first account from the system or user configuration file that has
a matching envelope-from address as specified by a \fBfrom\fP command. This
works only when neither \fB\-\-account\fP nor \fB\-\-host\fP is used.
.PP
If none of the above options is used (or if no account has a matching
\fBfrom\fP command), then the account "default" is used.
.PP
Msmtp transmits mails unaltered to the SMTP server, with the following exceptions:
.br
- The Bcc header(s) will be removed. This behavior can be changed with the
\fBremove_bcc_headers\fP command and \fB\-\-remove\-bcc\-headers\fP option.
.br
- A From header will be added if the mail does not have one. This can be changed
with the \fBadd_missing_from_header\fP command and
\fB\-\-add\-missing\-from\-header\fP option.
The header will use the envelope from address and optionally a full name set
with the \fB\-F\fP option.
.br
- A Date header will be added if the mail does not have one. This can be changed
with the \fBadd_missing_date_header\fP command and
\fB\-\-add\-missing\-date\-header\fP option.
.PP
Skip to the EXAMPLES section for a quick start.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
If it exists and is readable, a system wide configuration file
SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc will be loaded, where SYSCONFDIR depends on your platform.
Use \fB\-\-version\fP to find out which directory is used.
.br
If it exists and is readable, a user configuration file will be loaded
(~/.msmtprc will be tried first followed by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/msmtp/config by
default, but see \fB\-\-version\fP). Accounts defined in the user configuration
file override accounts from the system configuration file.
.br
Configuration data from either file can be changed by command line options.
.PP
A configuration file is a simple text file.  Empty lines and comment lines
(whose first non-blank character is `#') are ignored.
.br
Every other line must contain a command and may contain an argument to that
command.
.br
The argument may be enclosed in double quotes ("), for example if its first or
last character is a blank.
.br
If a file name starts with the tilde (~), this tilde will be replaced by $HOME.
If a command accepts the argument \fIon\fP, it also accepts an empty argument
and treats that as if it was \fIon\fP.
.br
Commands are organized in accounts. Each account starts with the \fBaccount\fP
command and defines the settings for one SMTP account.
.PP
Skip to the EXAMPLES section for a quick start.
.PP
Commands are as follows:
.IP "defaults"
Set defaults. The following configuration commands will set default values for
all following account definitions in the current configuration file.
.IP "account \fIname\fP [:\fIaccount\fP[,...]]"
Start a new account definition with the given name. The current default values
are filled in.
.br
If a colon and a list of previously defined accounts is given after the account
name, the new account, with the filled in default values, will inherit all
settings from the accounts in the list.
.IP "host \fIhostname\fP"
The SMTP server to send the mail to.
The argument may be a host name or a network address.
Every account definition must contain this command.
.IP "port \fInumber\fP"
The port that the SMTP server listens on.
The default is 25 ("smtp"), unless TLS without STARTTLS is used, in which case
it is 465 ("smtps").
.IP "source_ip [\fIIP\fP]"
Set a source IP address to bind the outgoing connection to. Useful only in
special cases on multi-home systems. An empty argument disables this.
.IP "proxy_host [\fIIP|hostname\fP]"
Use a SOCKS proxy. All network traffic will go through this proxy host,
including DNS queries, except for a DNS query that might be necessary to
resolve the proxy host name itself (this can be avoided by using an IP address
as proxy host name). An empty \fIhostname\fP argument disables proxy usage.
The supported SOCKS protocol version is 5. If you want to use this with Tor,
see also "Using msmtp with Tor" below.
.IP "proxy_port [\fInumber\fP]"
Set the port number for the proxy host. An empty \fInumber\fP argument resets
this to the default port.
.IP "timeout (\fIoff\fP|\fIseconds\fP)"
Set or unset a network timeout, in seconds. The argument \fIoff\fP means that no
timeout will be set, which means that the operating system default will be used.
.IP "protocol (\fIsmtp\fP|\fIlmtp\fP)"
Set the protocol to use. Currently only SMTP and LMTP are supported. SMTP is
the default. See the \fBport\fP command above for default ports.
.IP "domain \fIargument\fP"
Use this command to set the argument of the SMTP EHLO (or LMTP LHLO) command.
The default is \fIlocalhost\fP, which is stupid but usually works. Try to
change the default if mails get rejected due to anti-SPAM measures. Possible
choices are the domain part of your mail address (provider.example for
joe@provider.example) or the fully qualified domain name of your host (if
available).
.IP "auth [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP|\fImethod\fP)]"
Enable or disable authentication and optionally choose a method to use. The
argument \fIon\fP chooses a method automatically.
.br
Usually a user name and a password are used for authentication. The user name
is specified in the configuration file with the \fBuser\fP command. There are five
different methods to specify the password:
.br
1. Add the password to the system key ring.
Currently supported key rings are the Gnome key ring and the Mac OS X Keychain.
For the Gnome key ring, use the command secret\-tool (part of Gnome's
libsecret) to store passwords: secret\-tool store \-\-label=msmtp host
mail.freemail.example service smtp user joe.smith.
On Mac OS X, use the following command: security add\-internet\-password
\-s mail.freemail.example \-r smtp \-a joe.smith \-w.
In both examples, replace mail.freemail.example with the SMTP server name, and
joe.smith with your user name.
.br
2. Store the password in an encrypted files, and use \fBpasswordeval\fP
to specify a command to decrypt that file, e.g. using GnuPG. See EXAMPLES.
.br
3. Store the password in the configuration file using the \fBpassword\fP command.
(Usually it is not considered a good idea to store passwords in plain text files.
If you do it anyway, you must make sure that the file can only be read by yourself.)
.br
4. Store the password in ~/.netrc. This method is probably obsolete.
.br
5. Type the password into the terminal when it is required.
.br
It is recommended to use method 1 or 2.
.br
Multiple authentication methods exist. Most servers support only some of them.
Historically, sophisticated methods were developed to protect passwords from
being sent unencrypted to the server, but nowadays everybody needs TLS anyway,
so the simple methods suffice since the whole session is protected. A suitable
authentication method is chosen automatically, and when TLS is disabled for
some reason, only methods that avoid sending clear text passwords are
considered.
.br
The following user / password methods are supported: \fIplain\fP (a simple
plain text method, with base64 encoding, supported by almost all servers),
\fIscram\-sha\-1\fP (a method that avoids clear-text passwords),
\fIcram\-md5\fP (an obsolete method that avoids clear-text passwords, but is not
considered secure anymore),
\fIdigest\-md5\fP (an overcomplicated
obsolete method that avoids clear-text passwords, but is not considered secure
anymore), \fIlogin\fP (a non-standard clear-text method similar to but worse
than the plain method), \fIntlm\fP (an obscure non-standard method that is now
considered broken; it sometimes requires a special domain parameter passed via
\fBntlmdomain\fP).
.br
There are currently three authentication methods that are not based on user /
password information and have to be chosen manually: \fIoauthbearer\fP (an OAuth2
token from the mail provider is used as the password.
See the documentation of your mail provider for details on how to get this
token. The \fBpasswordeval\fP command can be used to pass the regularly changing
tokens into msmtp from a script or an environment variable),
\fIexternal\fP (the
authentication happens outside of the protocol, typically by sending a TLS
client certificate, and the method merely confirms that this authentication
succeeded), and \fIgssapi\fP (the Kerberos framework takes care of secure
authentication, only a user name is required).
.br
It depends on the underlying authentication library and its version whether a
particular method is supported or not. Use \fB\-\-version\fP to find out which
methods are supported.
.IP "user \fIlogin\fP"
Set the user name for authentication. An empty argument unsets the user name.
.IP "password \fIsecret\fP"
Set the password for authentication. An empty argument unsets the password.
Consider using the \fBpasswordeval\fP command or a key ring instead of this
command, to avoid storing plain text passwords in the configuration file.
.IP "passwordeval [\fIeval\fP]"
Set the password for authentication to the output (stdout) of the command
\fIeval\fP.
This can be used e.g. to decrypt password files on the fly or to query key
rings, and thus to avoid storing plain text passwords.
.IP "ntlmdomain [\fIdomain\fP]"
Set a domain for the \fBntlm\fP authentication method. This is obsolete.
.IP "tls [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Enable or disable TLS (also known as SSL) for secured connections.
.br
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
"... provides communications privacy over the Internet.  The protocol
allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to
prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery" (quote from RFC2246).
.br
A server can use TLS in one of two modes: via a STARTTLS command (the session
starts with the normal protocol initialization, and TLS is then
started using the protocol's STARTTLS command), or immediately (TLS is
initialized before the normal protocol initialization; this requires a
separate port). The first mode is the default, but you can switch to the
second mode by disabling \fBtls_starttls\fP.
.br
When TLS is started, the server sends a certificate to identify itself. To
verify the server identity, a client program is expected to check that the
certificate is formally correct and that it was issued by a Certificate
Authority (CA) that the user trusts. (There can also be certificate chains with
intermediate CAs.)
.br
The list of trusted CAs is specified using the \fBtls_trust_file\fP command.
The default value ist "system" and chooses the system-wide default, but you can
also choose the trusted CAs yourself.
.br
One practical problem with this approach is that the client program should also
check if the server certificate has been revoked for some reason, using a
Certificate Revocation List (CRL). A CRL file can be specified using the
\fBtls_crl_file\fP command, but getting the relevant CRL files and keeping them
up to date is not straightforward. You are basically on your own.
.br
A much more serious and fundamental problem is that you need to trust CAs.
Like any other organization, a CA can be incompetent, malicious, subverted by
bad people, or forced by government agencies to compromise end users without
telling them. All of these things happened and continue to happen worldwide.
The idea to have central organizations that have to be trusted for your
communication to be secure is fundamentally broken.
.br
Instead of putting trust in a CA, you can choose to trust only a single
certificate for the server you want to connect to. For that purpose, specify
the certificate fingerprint with \fBtls_fingerprint\fP. This makes sure that no
man-in-the-middle can fake the identity of the server by presenting you a
fraudulent certificate issued by some CA that happens to be in your trust list.
However, you have to update the fingerprint whenever the server certificate
changes, and you have to make sure that the change is legitimate each time,
e.g. when the old certificate expired. This is inconvenient, but it's the price
to pay.
.br
Information about a server certificate can be obtained with \fI\-\-serverinfo
\-\-tls \-\-tls\-certcheck=off\fP. This includes the issuer CA of the certificate (so
you can trust that CA via \fBtls_trust_file\fP), and the fingerprint of the
certificate (so you can trust that particular certificate via
\fBtls_fingerprint\fP).
.br
TLS also allows the server to verify the identity of the client. For this
purpose, the client has to present a certificate issued by a CA that the server
trusts. To present that certificate, the client also needs the matching key
file. You can set the certificate and key files using \fBtls_cert_file\fP and
\fBtls_key_file\fP. This mechanism can also be used to authenticate users, so
that traditional user / password authentication is not necessary anymore. See the
\fIexternal\fP mechanism in \fBauth\fP.
.br
You can also use client certificates stored on some external authentication
device by specifying GnuTLS device URIs in \fBtls_cert_file\fP and
\fBtls_key_file\fP. You can find the correct URIs using \fBp11tool
\-\-list-privkeys \-\-login\fP (p11tool is bundled with GnuTLS). If your device
requires a PIN to access the data, you can specify that using one of the
password mechanisms (e.g. \fBpasswordeval\fP, \fBpassword\fP). 
.IP "tls_starttls [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Choose the TLS variant: start TLS from within the session (\fIon\fP, default),
or tunnel the session through TLS (\fIoff\fP).
.IP "tls_trust_file \fIfile\fP"
Activate server certificate verification using a list of trusted Certification
Authorities (CAs). The default is the special value "system", which selects the
system default. An empty argument disables trust in CAs.
If you select a file, it must be in PEM format, and you should also use
\fBtls_crl_file\fP.
.IP "tls_crl_file [\fIfile\fP]"
Set a certificate revocation list (CRL) file for TLS, to check for revoked
certificates. An empty argument disables this.
.IP "tls_fingerprint [\fIfingerprint\fP]"
Set the fingerprint of a single certificate to accept for TLS. This certificate
will be trusted regardless of its contents (this overrides \fBtls_trust_file\fP).
The fingerprint should be of type SHA256, but can for backwards compatibility
also be of type SHA1 or MD5 (please avoid this).
The format should be 01:23:45:67:....
Use \fI\-\-serverinfo \-\-tls \-\-tls\-certcheck=off \-\-tls\-fingerprint=\fP
to get the server certificate fingerprint.
.IP "tls_key_file \fIfile\fP"
Send a client certificate to the server (use this together with
\fBtls_cert_file}\fP).
The file must contain the private key of a certificate in PEM format. An empty
argument disables this feature.
.IP "tls_cert_file \fIfile\fP"
Send a client certificate to the server (use this together with
\fBtls_key_file\fP).
The file must contain a certificate in PEM format. An empty argument disables
this feature.
.IP "tls_certcheck [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Enable or disable checks of the server certificate. They are enabled by default.
Disabling them will override \fBtls_trust_file\fP and \fBtls_fingerprint\fP.
WARNING: When the checks are disabled, TLS sessions will not be secure!
.IP "tls_min_dh_prime_bits [\fIbits\fP]"
Set or unset the minimum number of Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime bits that mpop
will accept for TLS sessions.  The default is set by the TLS library and can be
selected by using an empty argument to this command.  Only lower the default
(for example to 512 bits) if there is no other way to make TLS work with the
remote server.
.IP "tls_priorities [\fIpriorities\fP]"
Set the priorities for TLS sessions. The default is set by the TLS library and
can be selected by using an empty argument to this command.
See the GnuTLS documentation of the \fIgnutls_priority_init\fP function for a
description of the priorities string.
.IP "from \fIenvelope_from\fP"
Set the envelope-from address. This address will only be used when
\fIauto_from\fP is off.
.IP "auto_from [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]
Enable or disable automatic envelope-from addresses. The default is off.
When enabled, an envelope-from address of the form user@domain will be
generated.  The local part will be set to \fBUSER\fP or, if that fails, to
\fBLOGNAME\fP or, if that fails, to the login name of the current user.  The
domain part can be set with the \fBmaildomain\fP command.  If the maildomain
is empty, the envelope-from address will only consist of the user name and not
have a domain part. When auto_from is disabled, the envelope-from address must
be set explicitly.
.IP "maildomain [\fIdomain\fP]"
Set a domain part for the generation of an envelope-from address. This is only
used when \fIauto_from\fP is on. The domain may be empty.
.IP "dsn_notify (\fIoff\fP|\fIcondition\fP)"
This command sets the condition(s) under which the mail system should send DSN
(Delivery Status Notification) messages. The argument \fIoff\fP disables
explicit DSN requests, which means the mail system decides when to send DSN
messages. This is the default.
The \fIcondition\fP must be \fInever\fP, to never request notification, or a
comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more of the following:
\fIfailure\fP, to request notification on transmission failure, \fIdelay\fP, to
be notified of message delays, \fIsuccess\fP, to be notified of successful
transmission. The SMTP server must support the DSN extension.
.IP "dsn_return (\fIoff\fP|\fIamount\fP)"
This command controls how much of a mail should be returned in DSN (Delivery
Status Notification) messages. The argument \fIoff\fP disables explicit DSN
requests, which means the mail system decides how much of a mail it returns in
DSN messages. This is the default.
The \fIamount\fP must be \fIheaders\fP, to just return the message headers, or
\fIfull\fP, to return the full mail.  The SMTP server must support the DSN
extension.
.IP "add_missing_from_header [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
This command controls whether to add a From header if the mail does not have one.
The default is to add it.
.IP "add_missing_date_header [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
This command controls whether to add a Date header if the mail does not have one.
The default is to add it.
.IP "remove_bcc_headers [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
This command controls whether to remove Bcc headers. The default is to remove them.
.IP "logfile [\fIfile\fP]"
An empty argument disables logging (this is the default).
.br
When logging is enabled by choosing a log file, msmtp will append one line to
the log file for each mail it tries to send via the account that this log file
was chosen for.
.br
The line will include the following information: date and time in the format
specified by \fBlogfile_time_format\fP, host name of the
SMTP server, whether TLS was used, whether authentication was used,
authentication user name (only if authentication is used), envelope-from
address, recipient addresses, size of the mail as transferred to the server
(only if the delivery succeeded), SMTP status code and SMTP error message (only
in case of failure and only if available), error message (only in case of
failure and only if available), exit code (from sysexits.h; EX_OK indicates
success).
.br
If the filename is a dash (\-), msmtp prints the log line to the standard
output.
.IP "logfile_time_format [\fIfmt\fP]"
Set or unset the log file time format. This will be used as the format string
for the strftime() function. An empty argument chooses the default
("%b %d %H:%M:%S").
.IP "syslog [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP|\fIfacility\fP)]"
Enable or disable syslog logging. The facility can be one of LOG_USER, LOG_MAIL,
LOG_LOCAL0, ..., LOG_LOCAL7. The default is LOG_USER.
.br
Each time msmtp tries to send a mail via the account that contains this syslog
command, it will log one entry to the syslog service with the chosen facility.
.br
The line will include the following information: host name of the SMTP server,
whether TLS was used, whether authentication was used, envelope-from address,
recipient addresses, size of the mail as transferred to the server (only if the
delivery succeeded), SMTP status code and SMTP error message (only in case of
failure and only if available), error message (only in case of failure and only
if available), exit code (from sysexits.h; EX_OK indicates success).
.br
.IP "aliases [\fIfile\fP]"
Replace local recipients with addresses in the aliases file.  The aliases file
is a plain text file containing mappings between a local address and a list of
replacement addresses. The mappings are of the form:
.br
    local: someone@example.com, person@domain.example
.br
Multiple replacement addresses are separated with commas.  Comments start with `#'
and continue to the end of the line.
.br
The local address \fIdefault\fP has special significance and is matched if the
local address is not found in the aliases file.  If no \fIdefault\fP alias is
found, then the local address is left as is.
.br
An empty argument to the aliases command disables the replacement of local
addresses.  This is the default.

.br
# Password method 1: Add the password to the system keyring, and let msmtp get

.br

.br
# Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell msmtp
.br
# which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in

# this example. Usually gpg\-agent will ask once for the decryption password.
.br

.B Using msmtp with Mutt
.PP
Create a configuration file for msmtp and add the following lines to your
Mutt configuration file:
.br
.B set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp"
.br
.B set use_from=yes
.br
.B set realname="Your Name"
.br
.B set from=you@example.com
.br
.B set envelope_from=yes
.br
The envelope_from=yes option lets Mutt use the
.BR \-f
option of msmtp. Therefore msmtp chooses the first account that matches
the from address you@example.com.
.br
Alternatively, you can use the
.BR \-a
option:
.br
.B set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp \-a my\-account"
.br
Or set everything from the command line (but note that you cannot set a password
this way):
.br
.B set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp \-\-host=mailhub \-f me@example.com \-\-tls
.B \-\-tls\-trust\-file=trust.crt"
.PP
If you have multiple mail accounts in your msmtp configuration file
and let Mutt use the
.BR \-f
option to choose the right one, you can easily switch accounts in Mutt with
the following Mutt configuration lines:
.br
.B macro generic\ "<esc>1"\ ":set from=you@example.com"
.br
.B macro generic\ "<esc>2"\ ":set from=you@your\-employer.example"
.br
.B macro generic\ "<esc>3"\ ":set from=you@some\-other\-provider.example"

.PP
.B Using msmtp with mail
.PP
Define a default account, and put the following in your ~/.mailrc:
.br
.B set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp"

.PP
.B Using msmtp with Tor
.PP
Use the following settings:
.br
.B proxy_host 127.0.0.1
.br
.B proxy_port 9050
.br
.B tls on
.br
Use an IP address as proxy host name, so that msmtp does not leak a DNS query
when resolving it.
.br
TLS is required to prevent exit hosts from reading your SMTP session.
.br
Do not set \fBdomain\fP to something that you do not want to reveal (do not set
it at all if possible).

.PP
.B Aliases file
.PP
# Example aliases file

# Send root to Joe and Jane
.br
root: joe_smith@example.com, jane_chang@example.com

# Send cron to Mark
.br
cron: mark_jones@example.com

# Send everything else to admin
.br
default: admin@domain.example

.SH FILES
.IP "SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc"
System configuration file. Use
.B \-\-version
to find out what SYSCONFDIR is on your platform.
.IP "~/.msmtprc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/msmtp/config"
User configuration file.
.IP "~/.netrc and SYSCONFDIR/netrc"
The netrc file contains login information. Before prompting for a password,
msmtp will search it in ~/.netrc and SYSCONFDIR/netrc.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "USER, LOGNAME"
These variables override the user's login name when constructing an
envelope-from address. LOGNAME is only used if USER is unset.
.IP "TMPDIR"
Directory to create temporary files in. If this is unset, a system specific
default directory is used.
.br
A temporary file is only created when the
.BR \-t/\-\-read\-recipients
or
.BR \-\-read\-envelope\-from
option is used. The file is then used to buffer the headers of the mail (but not
the body, so the file won't get very large).
.IP "EMAIL, SMTPSERVER"
These environment variables are used only if neither \fB\-\-host\fP nor
\fB\-\-account\fP is used and there is no default account defined in the
configuration files. In this case, the host name is taken from SMTPSERVER, and
the envelope from address is taken from EMAIL, unless overridden by
\fB\-\-from\fP or \fB\-\-read\-envelope\-from\fP. Currently SMTPSERVER must
contain a plain host name (no URL), and EMAIL must contain a plain address (no
names or additional information).
