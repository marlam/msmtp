.SH NAME
msmtpd \- A minimal SMTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B msmtpd
[option...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Msmtpd is a minimal SMTP server that pipes mails to msmtp (or some other program) for delivery.
It is intended to be used with system services that expect an SMTP server on the local host and
cannot be configured to use the sendmail interface that msmtp provides.
.br
Msmtpd handles local SMTP clients. It listens on 127.0.0.1 port 25 by default, but can also run
without its own network sockets in inetd mode, where it handles a single SMTP session on
standard input / output.
.br
In the string that defines the command that msmtpd pipes each mail to, the first occurrence of
\fI%F\fP will be replaced with the envelope from address. Furthermore, all recipients of the
mail will be appended as arguments. The command must not write to standard output, as that would
mess up the SMTP session.
.br
Only run msmtpd if you know you need it. Only use a local interface to listen on. Take care
to run it with correct user rights and permissions (e.g. use \fICAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE\fP to bind
to port 25 instead of running as root, or use systemd with inetd service
capabilities). Be aware that the pipe command will be run as the same user that
msmtpd runs as.
